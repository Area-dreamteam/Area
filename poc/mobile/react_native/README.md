# React-Native POC
## Only front-end with a Login and Register Page

### Objective

- A simple login and register form
- No back-end connection and no database, API
- Basic page redirection with the path of the page when the user submit
- And a final page with Connect or Registered

### Installation and Run

To run the project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands:

``` bash

- cd poc

- npm run android
# or
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
# or
- npm run web
# or
- npx expo start

```

### Good points

Using this language seems easy.
Not much difficulty to understand how it works.
Possibility to go back to previous page and a menu bar already implemented.
One file per page -> no need to navigate through a lot of files to change one page's design or functionnalities.
